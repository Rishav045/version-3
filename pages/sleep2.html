        Dear, many a time, worrying about what others think of us stems from a need to be admired or validated by others. Wanting to be liked by others is a perfectly human desire. It only becomes a stressor if there is an imbalance between our need for validation from others and from ourselves.
        <br>
        If we feel too dependent on other peopleâ€™s perceptions of us, it could be a sign that weâ€™re having trouble trusting our own perception of ourselves. Perhaps there are some insecurities that weâ€™re struggling with, which causes us to worry more about what others think of us. ðŸ¤” <br>
        Letâ€™s try to understand what is making us worry about how others perceive us without judging ourselves for it. Remember, it is a very human need to want validation. It does not define us, and we should definitely judge ourselves for it. ðŸ¤—</p>
