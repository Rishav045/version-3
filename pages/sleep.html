    Hello dear!<br>
    Welcome to your safe space. ðŸŒ» 
    <br>
    <p id="text">

Worrying about being judged and what others think of us can get very stressful sometimes, donâ€™t you think?
<br>
It takes up most of our waking hours, and sometimes, even the hours that are meant for some much-needed sleep. ðŸ’¤
<br><br>    
Tossing and turning in bed because we canâ€™t stop thinking about everything we said or did during the day, wondering how others mustâ€™ve perceived them, and then waking up feeling fatigued and anxious, just to go through the same cycle again at night - all of this can get really exhausting. ðŸ˜ª 
<br>
But donâ€™t worry, there is a way out! Let us do our best to break this pattern, together. ðŸ’œ</p>
