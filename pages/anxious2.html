        Dear, There’s comfort in having a plan and sticking to it. Well, that probably explains why we make plans in the first place. 🤷🏻‍♀️<br>
        But unfortunately, life does not always go according to our plans. And sometimes, even when a single thing goes off-track, we feel like our plans are completely ruined. 😓 <br>

        The moment we are not able to tick off one item on our list, the entire plan feels inconsistent. Our feelings are chaotic, and nothing seems to be going well. ☹️ <br>

        Before moving any further ahead, shall we discuss the feeling that is bothering you at the moment?</p>
