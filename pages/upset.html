    Hello dear!<br>
    Welcome to your safe space. ðŸŒ»

    <p id="text">
    Our feelings- especially sadness-can be very tricky to understand, and even more difficult to control. When something upsets us, the feeling of sadness often manifests both emotionally and physically.

    <br>
    Sadness can often seem to be engulging us, and it feels like there are no ways to let our emotions out expect by crying.
    However, tearing up in a moment of sadness often ends up bringing feelings of guilt and shame, instead of providing us a sense of relief. This happens because many of us are taught that crying is a sign of weakness.</p>
